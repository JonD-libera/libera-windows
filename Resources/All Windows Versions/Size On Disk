Size On Disk
Sometimes we get asked how much disk space various versions of Windows use. 

Here are the answers I got, from installing each version as a VM on a Hyper-V system. Your mileage will vary, depending primarily on which hardware drivers and software you have installed. Hibernation settings and amount of installed RAM can also have large impacts.

Windows 10 Pro (fully updated on Sep 1, 2017; VMWare Workstation): 12.3GB

Windows 10 Home (fully updated on Sep 1, 2017; VMWare Workstation): 12.4GB

Windows 8.1 (fully updated on Nov 3, 2014): 14.3GB

Windows 8 (fully updated Nov 6, 2014): 22.6GB

Note that a Win8 system nags often about wanting to be upgraded to Win8.1 ... and you really should.

Windows 7 Ultimate (fully updated Nov 3, 2014): 25.6GB

Windows 7 Professional (fully updated Nov 5, 2014): 17.6GB

Windows 7 Home Premium (fully updated Nov 7 2014): 20.4GB

Windows Server 2012 R2 (fully updated Nov 4, 2012): 15.6GB

"Server with GUI" option chosen

Windows Server 2012:

Windows Server 2008r2 (fully updated Nov 11, 2014): 18.8GB

Windows Server 2008:

Vista Ultimate (fully updated Dec 6, 2014): 25.9GB

Windows XP Professional (fully updated on Nov 3, 2014): 7.03GB

Note that XP is no longer supported, and nags often to remind you of this!

Windows XP Home:

Method:

Install each OS version from TechNet media, choosing all defaults during the install. 

64bit versions of the OS were used unless otherwise noted.

Each VM was given 2GB of RAM.

Perform Windows Updates, including all Critical, Important, and Optional updates until there are no more to be found. 

Aactually I hid and did not install "Windows Live Essentials" and the "Bing Bar".

Run winver and get properties of C: drive, take a screenshot of these and add it to the web page below.

Document date and "used space" in list above.

Note that no additional software is installed.
