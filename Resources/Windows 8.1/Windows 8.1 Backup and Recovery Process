Win8.1 Backup + Recovery
Windows 8/8.1 presents several new backup and restore possibilities. I thought I would run through each of them and consider their usefulness in various situations. I'll provide a short video demonstrating each, so you can see them in action.

 

I've setup a Windows 8.1 system and updated it fully (see below for the system specs). Additionally I have installed a couple of Modern/Metro apps, and a couple of legacy desktop applications. I've created a few files in the Documents folder, and added a custom desktop image. From this baseline, I will walk through configuring each kind of backup, and then doing each kind of restore. After each restore I'll answer the following questions:

 

How long did the backup take?

How long did the restore take?

Are my Modern/Metro apps still present and installed?

Are my legacy desktop applications still installed?

Are my personal files still present in the Documents folder?

Is my custom desktop image still present?

Is the system still fully updated?
