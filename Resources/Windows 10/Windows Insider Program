Insider Program
Microsoft's Insider Program is the initiative Microsoft used to test and shape Windows 10 through external customer involvement.  Anyone can sign up and run the latest beta Windows builds from Microsoft.  It is not always a stable way to run your system but is available to anyone and a way you can help shape the future direction of Windows 10.
