Stronger security practices
The stringent security guides and practices listed below are probably overkill for the average home user. These are not security guesses written by bored fanboys on a rainy Sunday afternoon; they are security guides carefully written and justified by teams of professionals who ground their recommendations in technical facts.

We link these tools in the hopes that they will be useful to operational security professionals. We do not recommend that these guides be slavishly followed from A to Z, but rather seen as lists of technical protections from which any given organization can choose those defenses appropriate to the risks/dangers it faces.
