### A Windows channel on a FOSS-ish network? What's up with that?**

Yeah. Windows costs money (although free trials are available), and the source is not libre. But support doesn't have to cost money. We choose to provide support for Windows on this FOSS network because a) we love the attitude of this network and b) a lot of FOSS software runs on Windows.

We aim to provide knowledgeable help with Windows but are not Microsoft/Windows evangelists. No matter which OS you run, if you are happy with it, we are so glad for you. We see this as a simple matter of individual choice, not a Holy War of Ideology. We're not out to dominate the world or change anyone's mind.

So, we're not interested if you came here for a fight. But we're happy to answer questions or discuss the OS's strengths and weaknesses.

In case you're wondering, many people hanging around the channel are running Linux, BSD, or some other OS. Some channel regulars don't run Windows at all.
